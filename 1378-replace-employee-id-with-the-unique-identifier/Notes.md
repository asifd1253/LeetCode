Let’s go step by step using your query:

SELECT euni.unique_id, e.name
FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI euni
ON e.id = euni.id;

🔹 1. What is a JOIN in SQL?

A JOIN combines rows from two tables based on a related column (here it’s id).

Think of it as "merge rows when the condition matches."

🔹 2. Types of JOINs (quick overview)

INNER JOIN → keeps only rows that match in both tables.

LEFT JOIN → keeps all rows from the left table, even if there is no match in the right table.

RIGHT JOIN → keeps all rows from the right table.

FULL OUTER JOIN → keeps all rows from both tables.

🔹 3. LEFT JOIN specifically

When you write:

FROM Employees e
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI euni
ON e.id = euni.id


Employees is the left table.

EmployeeUNI is the right table.

SQL will:

Take all rows from Employees.

Try to find a matching row in EmployeeUNI where e.id = euni.id.

If a match exists → combine data from both tables.

If no match exists → keep the employee row but put NULL for missing EmployeeUNI values.

🔹 4. Dry Run with Your Example
Employees
| id | name     |
|----|----------|
| 1  | Alice    |
| 7  | Bob      |
| 11 | Meir     |
| 90 | Winston  |
| 3  | Jonathan |

EmployeeUNI
| id | unique_id |
|----|-----------|
| 3  | 1         |
| 11 | 2         |
| 90 | 3         |

Step 1 – Match IDs

Alice (id=1) → not in EmployeeUNI → unique_id = NULL

Bob (id=7) → not in EmployeeUNI → unique_id = NULL

Meir (id=11) → found in EmployeeUNI → unique_id = 2

Winston (id=90) → found in EmployeeUNI → unique_id = 3

Jonathan (id=3) → found in EmployeeUNI → unique_id = 1

Step 2 – Final Output
| unique_id | name     |
|-----------|----------|
| NULL      | Alice    |
| NULL      | Bob      |
| 2         | Meir     |
| 3         | Winston  |
| 1         | Jonathan |

🔹 5. Why LEFT JOIN (and not INNER JOIN)?

If we used INNER JOIN, only employees who have a match in EmployeeUNI would appear (Alice and Bob would be missing).

The question says: “If a user does not have a unique ID, show NULL.” → That’s exactly what LEFT JOIN does.

✅ So in simple words:
👉 LEFT JOIN = “Give me all employees. If they have a unique_id, show it. If not, put NULL.”
